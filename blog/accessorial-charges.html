        <div class="article-body">
            <p>Freight rates are fundamentally calculated based on a "Standard Dock-to-Dock" assumption. This means the
                carrier expects a 53-foot trailer to pull into a commercial loading dock where a forklift is ready, the
                driver does not have to help, and the street is wide enough for a tractor-trailer. Anything that
                deviates from this "perfect" scenario—any special equipment, special locations, or special handling—is
                billed as an <strong>Accessorial Charge</strong>.</p>

            <p>In 2026, accessorials are the primary area where "Cheap" freight quotes turn into "Expensive" freight
                invoices. If you don't declare these requirements upfront, carriers often apply "Corrected" fees after
                the delivery, which are frequently 50-100% higher than the pre-booked rate. Understanding these line
                items is the difference between a profitable shipment and a financial loss.</p>

            <h2>The "Big 3" Accessorials: The Most Common Surcharges</h2>

            <h3>1. Liftgate Service ($50 - $150)</h3>
            <p>Standard freight trucks are designed for loading docks (48 to 52 inches high). If the shipper or
                consignee (the receiver) does not have a loading dock or a forklift, the truck must be equipped with a
                hydraulic liftgate to lower the pallet from the bed to the ground.
                <br><strong>The Gap:</strong> Not all trucks have liftgates. If you don't request one and a non-liftgate
                truck arrives, the driver will "Abort" the delivery. You will then be billed for a "Re-delivery" fee
                PLUS the original liftgate fee.
            </p>

            <h3>2. The "Residential" Trap ($75 - $150)</h3>
            <p>A common misconception is that "Residential" refers to a home. In 2026 carrier tariffs, a residential
                delivery is defined as **any location that is not a commercial property with a dock**.
                <br>This includes:
                <br>• Home offices in upscale neighborhoods.
                <br>• Farmhouses or agricultural properties.
                <br>• Businesses located on "Dead End" streets or narrow residential lanes.
                <br>Carriers use "AI Location Auditing" to cross-reference addresses against zoning data and satellite
                imagery. If their algorithm sees a driveway instead of a dock, the fee is auto-applied to your invoice.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Limited Access ($50 - $100)</h3>
            <p>This fee is often confused with Residential, but it applies to commercial or government sites that are
                "Hard to Get To."
                <br>Common triggers include:
                <br>• **Schools and Universities:** High pedestrian traffic and security gates.
                <br>• **Construction Sites:** Unpaved roads and dynamic unloading areas.
                <br>• **Hospitals:** Strict receiving hours and "No Idle" zones.
                <br>• **Storage Units:** Narrow corridors where a 53-foot trailer physically cannot turn.
            </p>

            <h2>Inside Delivery vs. "White Glove"</h2>
            <p>An **Inside Delivery** ($75 - $150) fee is triggered the moment the driver takes the pallet through the
                "First Threshold" of the building. In most standard LTL contracts, "Delivery" means dropping the pallet
                on the ground (via liftgate) or at the dock. If the driver brings that pallet into the lobby, garage, or
                elevator, the clock starts on an Inside Delivery charge.</p>
            <p>**Warning:** Inside delivery does not mean "White Glove." The driver will not unwrap the pallet, carry
                items up stairs, or remove debris. If you need that level of service, you are looking for a **Final Mile
                Specialist**, not a standard LTL carrier.</p>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>Stop Overpaying for "Blind" Fees</h3>
                <p>Most location-based fees are non-negotiable, but your base rate is. Ensure your density is accurate
                    to offset these costs.</p>
                <a href="../index.html" class="cta-btn">Calculate Precision Density</a>
            </div>

            <h2>The "Time is Money" Fees: Detention and Layover</h2>
            <p>Drivers have strict HOS (Hours of Service) regulations. If they are sitting at your dock, they aren't
                making money.
                <br>**Detention:** Most carriers give 30 minutes of "Free Time." If you take 45 minutes to unload, you
                will be billed for "Detention" at a rate typically around $50 to $75 per 15-minute increment. In 2026,
                trucks use GPS and geofencing to auto-log their "Arrival" and "Departure" times, making it impossible to
                "Negotiate" away a detention fee with the driver.
            </p>

            <h2>Sorting and Segregating ($0.75 - $1.50 per piece)</h2>
            <p>If you ship a pallet containing 50 individual boxes and the receiver asks the driver to "Break the shrink
                wrap and count/match each box against the packing slip," you will be hit with a **Sort & Seg** fee. This
                is common at retail distribution centers (like Walmart or Target). It is almost always cheaper to
                palletize goods by SKU to avoid this manual labor surcharge.</p>

            <h2>The 2026 "Tech Fee"</h2>
            <p>A new accessorial appearing in late 2025/2026 is the **Admin Audit Fee** or **Verification Fee**. This is
                a flat charge ($15 - $35) for the carrier to run your pallet through their Dimensioning machine
                (Cubiscan) to verify your "Self-Declared" weight and class. Shippers who consistently provide accurate
                data from tools like ours can often get this "Trust Fee" waived in their annual contracts.</p>

            <h2>Overlength and Oversized Pallets</h2>
            <p>LTL trailers use 96-inch to 102-inch widths. If your pallet is 144 inches (12 feet) long, it occupies the
                space of three standard pallets.
                <br>• **8ft+ Overlength:** ~$150 surcharge.
                <br>• **12ft+ Overlength:** ~$300+ surcharge (often moves to FTL or Volume rates).
                <br>Carriers hate overlength because they cannot "Stack" anything on top or beside it, creating "Dead
                Air" in the trailer that you must pay for.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Cost of the "Missed" Accessorial</h2>
            <p>The golden rule of logistics is **Declaration**. If you need a liftgate, declare it. If you are shipping
                to a school, flag it. The cost of a "Re-delivery" attempt after a driver fails to unload is often more
                than the original liftgate fee. By being transparent and optimizing your base freight density with our

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>Optimize Your Total Cost</h3>
                <p>Know your metrics before you ship. Accurate density leads to better base rates, regardless of
                    accessorials.</p>
