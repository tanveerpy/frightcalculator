        <div class="article-body">
            <p>You’ve successfully navigated the ocean voyage. Your 40-foot High Cube container has survived the Pacific
                crossing and is now sitting on a massive quay at the Port of Los Angeles. But your warehouse is 40 miles
                away in Ontario, California. You can't just drive your pickup truck to the port to get it. You need a
                specialized logistics service that bridges the gap between the ship's crane and the warehouse's dock.
                You need **Drayage**.</p>

            <p>In 2026, drayage is the "High-Intensity" first mile of the inland supply chain. It is a world of
                restricted access, specialized equipment, and punishing fees for even the slightest delay. While it is
                often the shortest leg of a journey in terms of miles, it can be the most expensive in terms of
                complexity. This guide explains the technical world of drayage and how to avoid the "Port Traps" that
                drain your budget.</p>

            <h2>Phase 1: What is Drayage? (The Infrastructure Connector)</h2>
            <p>Drayage is the transport of goods over short distances, typically connecting an ocean port or rail ramp
                to a warehouse, trucking terminal, or cross-dock. The term comes from the 19th-century "dray," a
                horse-drawn cart used to haul goods. Today, it refers to the fleet of heavy-duty tractors that
                specialize in "Shuttling" containers between secure gates.</p>

            <h2>The Port Ecosystem: Why You Can't "DIY" It</h2>
            <p>Entering an American port in 2026 is like entering a military base. To perform drayage, a driver needs
                more than just a CDL; they need a **TWIC (Transportation Worker Identification Credential)** card. This
                requires a TSA background check and biometric verification. Furthermore, drayage companies must be
                registered with the **UIIA (Uniform Intermodal Interchange Agreement)**, a legal framework that allows
                them to "Interchange" (borrow) equipment from shipping lines.</p>

            <h2>The "Chassis" Dilemma: The Wheels You Don't Own</h2>
            <p>A shipping container is just a metal box; it has no wheels. To move it on a highway, it must sit on a
                **Chassis**—a specialized trailer frame.
                <br>**The Catch:** Most drayage companies do not own their own chassis. They borrow them from a "Chassis
                Pool" (like DCLI or TRAC).
                <br>**The Fee:** You will see a "Chassis Usage Fee" on your invoice, typically $35 to $60 per day.
                Additionally, if the container is at Port A but the chassis is at Terminal B, you will be hit with a
                **Chassis Split** fee (usually $75+) to cover the driver's time moving between locations.
            </p>

            <h2>Phase 2: The Two Clocks - Demurrage vs. Detention</h2>
            <p>In drayage, time is measured in hundreds of dollars. There are two critical clocks you must watch:
                <br>1. **Demurrage (The Port's Clock):** This is the fee for the container staying on the port floor
                past its "Free Time" (usually 4-5 days). If you don't pick it up, the port charges you daily, and the
                rate often "escalates" (e.g., $150/day for days 1-3, $300/day for days 4+).
                <br>2. **Detention (The Steamship Line's Clock):** Also known as "Per Diem." This starts when the
                container leaves the port. You have an "Allowed" number of days to take it to your warehouse, empty it
                (devanning), and return the empty box to the port. If you are late, the shipping line charges you for
                every extra day.
            </p>

            <div class="cta-box">
                <h3>From Container to Pallet</h3>
                <p>Once your container is devanned, your goods become LTL freight. Ensure your density is correct before
                    you stage the final mile.</p>
                <a href="../index.html" class="cta-btn">Calculate LTL Density Now</a>
            </div>

            <h2>2026 Tech: AI-Driven Gate Turn Optimization</h2>
            <p>Historically, drayage drivers would sit in line for 4-6 hours waiting to get a box. In 2026, "Smart
                Ports" use **Appointment-Based Gate Systems**. Using AI, the port predicts when a container will be
                "Accessible" (off the bottom of the stack) and assigns a 30-minute window for the drayage driver.
                <br>**The Impact:** This has reduced "Congestion Fees" for shippers who use tech-forward drayage
                partners. If your driver misses their window, they are locked out, and you are hit with a **No-Show
                Fee** ($150+).
            </p>

            <h2>The "Street Turn" Strategy</h2>
            <p>By 2026, the most efficient drayage companies use **Triangulation** or "Street Turns."
                <br>Instead of returning an empty container to the port and then picking up a new full one, the software
                finds a nearby exporter who needs an empty box. The driver drops the empty container directly at the new
                shipper's door. This eliminates two trips to the port, saving the shipper massive "Fuel Surcharges" and
                "Stop-Off" fees.
            </p>

            <h2>Drayage Weights: The "Road Legal" Math</h2>
            <p>A 20ft container can physically hold 48,000 lbs of cargo. However, once you add the weight of the truck
                and the chassis, it often exceeds the **80,000 lbs Federal Bridge Gross Weight Limit**.
                <br>**The Solution:** Drayage companies use "Tri-Axle" chassis to distribute weight further, but this
                requires an **Overweight Permit** and often a specialized route. If you are shipping heavy commodities
                (tiles, liquids, metals), your drayage quote will include "Overweight Surcharges" that can be $100 -
                $300 per move.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Handover to LTL</h2>
            <p>Drayage is the sprint that starts the marathon. Once that container reaches your warehouse and is
                "Stripped" (devanned), the cargo is palletized and enters the domestic LTL network. This is where the
                physics of shipping shifts from "Boxes and Chassis" to "Weight and Density." Use our <a
                    href="../index.html">Precision Density Calculator</a> to ensure that as your goods transition from
                their international drayage leg to their final domestic destination, your freight class is optimized to
                keep your total landed cost as low as possible.</p>
